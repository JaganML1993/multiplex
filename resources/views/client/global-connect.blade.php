                                    <p>Our efforts are constantly ameliorating global relations and one such
                                        illustration is when the Republic of Djibouti, Africa, signed a Memorandum of
                                        Understanding (MoU) with Multiplex Group entering into a joint venture,
                                        approaching the company to supervise 12,000 acres of wheat project, located in
                                        Ethiopia, Africa. Implemented with the best of our endeavours, the project was a
                                        major success and was well accomplished in time. The project required the local
                                        farmers to be handled, which was done responsibly and vigilantly. Continuing for
                                        a span of 5 years, the project successfully met its expectations.</p>
                                    <p>Yet another bosting overseas prospect came into existence, when we incepted
                                        exporting to Sultanate of Oman, Sri Lanka, Thailand, Vietnam and Indonesia in
                                        the 1990’s. We further proliferated in 2000 and began exporting to Mauritius,
                                        Malaysia, Bangladesh, China, Nepal, Muscat and Egypt.</p>
                                    <p>By the mid of 2009’s, we had already expanded to Djibouti, Ethiopia which can all
                                        be owed to the tenacious aspirations and efforts of our Managing Director Mr.
                                        Mahesh G. Shetty, Honorary Consulate of the Republic of Djibouti.</p>
                                    <p>Additionally, we possessed Venezuela, Cyprus, Lebanon, Maldives and Kenya in our
                                        trading spectrum since the dawn of 2011. Likewise, Japan continues to be our
                                        cardinal trade partner.</p>
                                    <p>Our agricultural products have been moving across the vital trading countries and
                                        has fortify the situation of the farmers, in real sense. In recognition of our
                                        stupendous development manoeuvres and research perpetrated, in 2008, The
                                        Fertilizers Association of India (FAI), New Delhi, awarded us for superior
                                        quality “Production, Promotion and Marketing of Bio-Fertilizers”.</p>
                                    <p>Besides the aforesaid deployments in the trading industry of the agriculture
                                        arena, the Multiplex Group continues to serve the overseas farming sector and
                                        bestow every possible help to upliftment the farmers and their families. We had
                                        incepted with “Multiplex Farmer Happy Farmer” motto and continue to work to
                                        uphold the dignity.</p>
